# P2P 
Project to combine the Ear2Ear project, encrypted chat, and the pseudo-security projects together. 
The goal here is to create a command line application for Peer-to-Peer file sharing, messaging and
sharing of personal music libraries with each other.

# Install 
Currently being developed for linux. You can clone the project from this repository, 
and then run the build.sh script. For now the project will only work for users whos
credentials will be located in the usrbase.txt file 

The adding of new users, is still being developed. In fact this whole thing is still under 
development much like every other project I have here on Github.
